the expression to suggest that attitude

head aa he npproacbce his adversary. and
sets his horns in a position suited for stab-
bing. Thia view would seem to be con·
drrned by the words arbor-is obnisus trunco.

Cf. Eurip. Bacch.. 742, κἰἰς κὲρας θυμού-

μίνοι, and AEn. xii. 104. where these verses
occur with a slight variation.

true, that bulis nim blows with feet and

movements which gladiatura were wont to
practice aa n prolude to the fight. This was
expressed by the verb ventilare. Proludae

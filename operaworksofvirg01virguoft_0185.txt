277. Nec aecius—The discussions on this
vexed passage are so voluminous that we
cannot transfer them to these pagos: but
the student may with profit consult
Wagner. Forb.. and other commentatore
referred to by them. We shall content
oursetves with explaining thc reading and
punctuation which are adopted in the text
attached 1ο these notes. The meaning is,
tr you plant your vines in a rich soil, you
may set them closely without very rigor-
ous attention to orderly arrangement, and
equidistant rows3 but if you choose hilis
i'or your trees (Le. vines) be carei'ul to give
abundancc os room between the rows; and
be not less earesul [than you are in qiu-‘no
abundance of room] to plant your vines
with scrupulous accuracy (in unquem) as to
interval, so that each passage (between the
rows) may be at right angles ‹perpendicu-
lar) to the path which crosses it: that is,
plant with euch rigorous exactness that
there shall be an equal distance between
each pair oi' contiguous trees. whether you
measure the straight (longitudinal) paths,
or those that crosa at right angles. or those
that run diagonaliy. Our meaning will be
best understood by the figure ot* the quin-
cunx. which was so arranged that no matter
111 what position a spectator stood. he saw
along between the rows in (at least two)
maerent dimetiens without obstruction.

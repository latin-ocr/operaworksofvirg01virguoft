¹111. Parthorum -The Parthians were
also particularly subservient to their mon-
arche. Medus Hydaspes—The Hydaspes is
one ofthe rivers of the l'anjab, and is now
called Jelum, or Djelun. or Behut. It rises
in one of the summite of the Parapamisus
range. which extends into the empire of the
ancient Persia: hence, ns the Mcdes and
Per-sinus were closely associated in history,
and in geographica! position, the term Mc-
das is applied to this river. though in a
slightly improper sense. The Hydaspes
(Jelum) falls into the Chenai). and it again
into the Indus.

to in Notc on first line of this Georgic.

210. In this passage the doctrines of Py-

subject.. see AEn. vi. 534, sqq. Observe the
very remarkable construction of aeque coup-

nom.. and see Note, Geo. 1. 142.

220. Par-cem divinae mentis, ccc.. “a por-
tion of. or an emanatlon from, the divine
intelligence.'' The idea was that a life-
giving and active principle pervaded all ua-
ture; that to this was due the existence ot*
every creature: and that, on the death or
any living thing. the particula mentis divi-
nae returned to the great soz-ree whence it
came. and again amalgamatcd with its
original whole. Aetherios haustus is merely
n variety οι· expression (for the sake os
greater clearness) ot· the foregoiug phrase,

the interpretation of these words is perplex-
ing in the extreme. Some books exhiblt
orejave, “observc asolemn silence'· Others
ore soce, “spirt water from your mouth'·
on the bees. to prevent them from stinging
you. Sparsus would then mean “sprink-
iing thcm.'' Servius. The reading of the
text is that which has the best MS. autho-
rity, and which. morem-er. yields the most
appropriate meaning. As the Roman ru·-
tics were in the habit of eating garllc and
other strong scented herbsv and as the
senso of smell in bees is very acute, the
poet orders that the brcath ot· the honey
collector should be purified aad sweetcned
before he approached the hive. Ora sou
therefore means ¹¹cleanse and sweeten your
mouth and breath;” cf. Geo. ii. 135, animas
ee olentia Medi orasorene illo.- see also AEn.
11ίί. 420, Fovit vulnus lympha. But our
great difficulty lies in sparsus for which
parcas. pastus, pransus, have been severally
conjectured. 1t is evident thet sparsus. i(
joined to haustu. is used in a very pecuum·
sense. for in its common acceptation lt is
entirely opposed to the idea ofa sinqle mouth-
[υἱ of water. We therefore talto sparsus to
refer to the washinq oi the whole body, which
would be particularly necessary i’or those
who, like lahem-ers. were exposed to violent
perspirations. We would therefore trans-
late as follows: ¹⁸ llam-ing previously washcd
your body, somcnt yourmouth with draughts
(the drawing) of water: '¹ or. as Anthou
has it, “gargle your mouth with a draught
of watcr.'' 'ruis is Schiraeh's interpretation,
but it is not free from objections; nor are
wc satisiied with any other which we have
seen. sequaces is a most appropriate term.
as applied ιο fumos, snioke, which penc-
trates every nook and cranny, and which.
from its very lightncss and unsubstnntinlity,
is easily drawn by the force of attractlou to
any body into whose neighbourhood it may
come.

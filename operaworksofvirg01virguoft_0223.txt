1. We have now come to the fourth and
last division or the subject—the rearing ot·
bees, and the making ot* honey. On the
alleged difference between protinus and
protenus, see Note on Ecl. i. 13. The adj.
aerius is applied to mel, ln accordance with
the ancient notion that the bees collected
the honey from the timo, which came down
ex aire. For a similar reason coelestia dona
is used. It was only the substance of wax
which was considered derivable from
flowers. On the subject ot· bees consult

thus to lend confirmation to the view we

8. A suitabie position sor the hee—hives ls
first to be sought, and care is to be taken
that it be as much sheltered as possible. and
that the apiary be so lenced round about as
that kids and heii‘crs may not intersere with
the operations os the honey makers. Itis
said that sedes and seatio are identical in
meaning. But we think that sedes is used
ln a wider sense, ot* a considerable space ot·
ground. suited by its abundance ot* tiowers,
by its retirement and non-exposure to the
inroads of cattle, ror the purpose in view:
while seatio means a particular spot ln such
an apim-y, where shelter can be readily as-
sorded to the hive, more especially to the
door ot· it, which, for the reasons aster-
wards stated, itis most important to keep
calm and peacet'ui. We are led to this deci·
sion by the following considerations:—lst,

would. in the sumo line. use two words
exactly identical in significatiom 211, Statio

overawing the neighbourhood, or the quar-d

diately succeedlng, Quo neque sie centis

why especial care should be taken ln having

swering to seatio. the word nearest to lt; and

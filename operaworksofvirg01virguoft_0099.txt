63. Sequitur. This word is applied in a
slightly dinei-ent sense to the several occu-
naves which it governs, but stili there is
the idea of the suine eaniest pursuit of n

Quorum. Note the peculim-{ty of this
relative. which is in the plur„ while its ante-
cedent oliqm'd is in the singular. Aliquid.
being a partitive word, implies a plural.
and this is therefore another instance of tho

poet iiinking the relative agree with tho

3¹31. Taurino vultu—It was very common
among the ancients to represent the deitics
os rivers as possessing horas: so in AEn. vill.
77, we have the epithet cor-niqer applied to
the Tiber. For the comptu-Isou of a river
to a bull. many explanatione have been nt-
tempted: (1) Some have said that Virgil's
phrase is a mere imitation of Homer's
μὲμϋκῶἰ ”²¹7⁷ss ταῦρος, applied to the Xan-
thus, nnd that the resemblance is between
the river's roar and the bull's beilou-ing:

(2) The ocean is also called ταυρᾶκρανσν
by Eut-ip.. Or. 1356, the idea being the im-
petuosity osa river. conJoined with the sav-
age violence ol the buil. From this virgil
has borrowed his expression. (3) Others
are ot* opinion that the cun-ing banks. and
tho separation os the stream into mouths
may have suggested the idea of bent horus
extending in ‹lilii-rent directions from one
head. &Vc are not entirely satisfied with
any of these explanatione, but from the
use os vultu. and from other consideratione,
we prefer the last to either os the other two.

messing great value; or (3,) because such
epitheta as ¹¹goldeu'' are frequently applied
to the goda.

We believe. however. that the true ex-
planation os the term na here employed la
different from all these. It is well lmown
that the horna orbuns about to be offered
in sacrifice. or led in prot-esaion (eff. ln tho
